Welcome to the Github space where WordPress community members coordinate content for the Developer Blog.

The Developer Blog is in the pre-launch phase. 

The proposal to [create a Developer Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/25/proposal-to-start-a-news-blog-on-developer-wordpress-org/) was published in February 2022

In July 2022, the [proposal for the editorial processes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/06/proposed-editorial-process-for-the-new-developer-blog/) was published. 

In the meantime, the WordPress meta team created the site and the block theme for the new site.
