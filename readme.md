# Welcome 

to the Github space where WordPress community members coordinate content for the Developer Blog.

The Developer Blog is in the pre-launch phase. 

The proposal to [create a Developer Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/25/proposal-to-start-a-news-blog-on-developer-wordpress-org/) was published in February 2022

In July 2022, the [proposal for the editorial processes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/06/proposed-editorial-process-for-the-new-developer-blog/) was published. 

In the meantime, the WordPress meta team created the site on the developer network and provided the new block theme. 

For discussion, questions and meetings, please join the WordPress [#core-dev-blog](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03RL47B3S8) channel.
